      <p class="p1"> A healthy lifestyle is important for everyone. When we look after our physical health, we look and feel better and are better able to cope with certain things. Some people may think that only persons who are fat or overweight should exercise, that's not the case. Anyone can exercise, exercising is not only about losing weight, it's also about keeping fit and healthy. Being healthy should be part of your overall lifestyle. Living a healthy lifestyle can help prevent chronic diseases and long-term illnesses. Eat well also. Balance you meals, have protein, healthy carbohydrate, fat and vegetables at each meal. Healthy carbohydrates include, brown rice,whole wheat breads, pastas and crackers. Eat three meals each day, snacks can be eaten bewteen meals. If you are on medications be sure to take them on time. You can set reminders on your phone to remind you when it's time to take them.</p>

      <p class="p2">If possible, try to exercise at least 30 minutes each day, three times per week. Finding a physical activity that you enjoy doing will make exercise much more fun and something to look forward to. Try to get enough sleep. Sleep deprivation contributes to increased apetite and often body weight and decreases brain function. Proper sleep helps your energy, weight maintenance and your ability to think and concentrate. <strong>Remember good health is not just the absence of disease or illness, it is a state of complete physical, mental and social well being.
